# RentYourDreamCar
Project to test advanced PHP with MWC (Model View Controller). HTML/CSS on project was only to highligh PHP. Advanced SQL request. Use of LocalStorage for the basket and AJAX to send the data to PHP (and then Database). Double check for forms, JS and PHP side.

This was a project group, and it went very smoothly proving I could work as a team and be efficient.
